    # The Views.php file
    
    This is where you define views.
    Views are used to provide you with an entire page worth of content.
    If you are using a view inside another view, you probably want to use
    a module or section instead. Views can only be loaded from the server-side.
    This discourages you from reloading them by replacing HTML, since they are
    intended to be entire pages.
    
    Call a view from the server-side using:
      tx('Component')->views('{{NAME}}')->get_html('function_name', Data($options));
